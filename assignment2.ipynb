        "This paper is about a new framework to tidy messy datasets. The goal of this research is to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. \n",

        "<b>2.</b>\n",
        "The tidy data standard is intended to accomplish several things, such as facilitating the exploration and analysis of data, reduce data munging, and bridging the gap between the organization and analysis of data. By having the tidy data standard, analysts can keep datasets consistent, and collaboration can be streamlined between people. \n",

        "\n",
        "<b>3.</b>\n",
        "\"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way\". This sentence is basically saying that just as families have similar characteristics that make them happy, datasets have things that make them \"tidy\" as well. In contrast, just as every unhappy family has problems, every messy dataset has some problems as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "\"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general\". This sentence is basically saying that for sp0ecific datasets, like those for houses, it is easy to figure out the observations and the attributes/features that describe those observations. However, it is very difficult to find a universal definition for observations and features because different datasets from different domains have different kinds of observations and features. \n",

        "<b>4.</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "Values:\n",
        "Values are defined as something that belongs to a variable and an observation. More specifically, the values are either numbers if they are quantitative and strings if they are qualitative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Variables:\n",
        "These are the things that contain the values. They contain the values that define a trait (such as height, temperature, and duration). As a result, they can hold both quantitative and qualitative data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Observations:\n",
        "Observations are also things that values belong to. The observation contains all values measured on the same unit across different attributes. \n",

        "<b>5.</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "Tidy data is defined as \"a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure\" according to section 2.3. In tidy data, each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>6.</b>\n",
        "The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are as follows: Column headers are values, not variable names. Multiple variables are stored in one column. Variables are stored in both rows and columns. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The data in table 4 is messy because the column headers are values and not variable names. \"Melting\" a dataset is to turn the columns of the dataset into rows. This can help clean the data because it can turn the column headers that are values into rows instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>7.</b>\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason that table 11 is messy is because there are multiple types in one table. For example, the fact that there is a column for every day in the month makes it messy along with the multiple types (tmax and tmin) in one column. Table 12 is tidy and molten because it consolidates the dates and values into two columns (date and value) for the molten data. The tidy data separates the multiple types in one table and makes two columns from that (tmax and tmin), eliminating the need of an element/value column as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "<b>8.</b>\n",
        "The chicken and egg problem is the interdependence between tidy data and the tools that work with it. If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then the tools will be too specialized to the structure of the tidy data. This leads to a situation where changing the data structures or tools won't improve the workflow. This results in a state where it seems like the current methodology is optimal but is actually suboptimal.\n",

        "3. Please provide a constructive criticism of how the Census was conducted: What was done well? What do you think was missing? How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",
